## **FreeVox** editor
A library that provides an extensive application programming interface (API) for full **FreeVox projects editing**. It interacts with the running in the FreeVox player project providing real-time editing. It's designed for programs that need interaction with the project including DAWs.
## **FreeVox** renderer
This library is designed for **modules settings graphical interfaces rendering and interacting with them**. It implements something like **plug-in system** that, unfortunately, has some limitations for allowance to mobile platforms. But there are that familiar twisters, sliders and graphs. User's module settings graphical interface can be created and modified by the FreeVox editor library or the program for visual editing of these interfaces that's based on it.
